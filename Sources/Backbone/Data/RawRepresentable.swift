extension RawRepresentable {

  /// Returns the raw value represented by this instance.
  ///
  /// Prefix `RawRepresentable` values with (`*`) to access its raw value
  /// instead of invoking the literal variable `rawValue`.
  ///
  /// ## Rationale
  ///
  /// The primary, and arguably only, purpose of `RawRepresentable.rawValue`
  /// is to serve as plumbing. It's a syntactic facility with little to no
  /// semantic value. In other words, it's not the "meat" of your program.
  ///
  /// Therefore, a valid case can be presented for deemphasizing this operation.
  ///
  /// Functions that serve as plumbing make up the structure, not the
  /// **content** of an expression.
  ///
  /// _They're the code equivalent of_ **prepositions** _and_ **punctuation**
  /// **marks**.
  ///
  /// Operators are useful for this sort of plumbing because they make it easy
  /// to concentrate on the **content** of an expression while also breaking it
  /// into parts. I think of them as visual bookmarks. With a bit of experience,
  /// plumbing operators make code easier to read at a glanceâ€”a universally
  /// useful property.
  ///
  /// ## Term of art
  ///
  /// The prefix asterisk is known in the C-family of languages as the
  /// indirection (or dereference) operator and it's purpose is to allow
  /// users to operate on the raw value (l-value) that a reference (r-value)
  /// points to by returning the l-value itself.
  ///
  /// `RawRepresentable` is a reference type. In computer science, a reference
  /// is a value that enables a program to indirectly access a particular datum,
  /// such as a variable's value or a record, in the computer's memory or in
  /// some other storage device.
  ///
  /// The reference is said to refer to the datum, and accessing the datum is
  /// called dereferencing the reference.
  ///
  /// - Parameter rep: The instance representing the value.
  /// - Returns: The raw value this instance represents.

  /// standard library for any type that conforms to `Comparable`.
